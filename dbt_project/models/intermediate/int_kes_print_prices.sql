-- Canonical 4D print price matrix: technique × color_count × area_range × quantity.
-- Unpivots 9 fixed quantity breakpoints; derives quantity_max via LEAD window function.
-- area_min/max converted from cm² to mm² (×100).
-- product_ref is NULL — KES print prices are global (not per product), same as VTA.
