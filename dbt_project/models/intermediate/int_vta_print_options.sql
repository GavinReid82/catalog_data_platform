-- Collapse duplicates that arise when multiple S3 date-partitions are read.
-- Some rows share the same (product_ref, teccode, areacode) but have different
-- area dimensions because the supplier updated them between extractions.
-- MAX picks the most permissive value; technique_name is stable per teccode.
